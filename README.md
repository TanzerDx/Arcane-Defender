Arcane Defender is a 2D Tower Defense game based in a post-apocalyptic environment. The gameplay focuses primarily on strategic placement and upgrades of the towers. You should either decide on whether to place more towers for an upcoming wave or upgrade existing ones. You are also obliged to separate your time accordingly between each wave so that you can build and upgrade specific towers. This not only makes the player under constant pressure, but also makes them think ahead of time to plan their upcoming actions and next build plan. Moreover, there may be points in time where you must decide on what to spend resources on: defences upgrades or character upgrades. 

Unlike more traditional tower defence games, the player is moveable around the playable area. They can attack the enemy, but the enemy can also attack the player. However, without towers, the enemy gets progressively impossible to defeat, so our character is always in need of towers that will help them to protect the settlement. 

You must build magic towers to defeat the upcoming waves of enemies. The towers can be built and upgraded by using resources and magic energy crystals that are dropped from the enemy. The quantity of resources that the enemy drops when defeated progressively gets bigger, becoming much easier to obtain. 

Your playable character has an HP limit and an inventory to keep track of how much crystals and resources they have, and if it dies, they will reappear later, losing some time.  To make it easier for the player to survive, they can upgrade their towers. Each upgrade becomes increasingly expensive, but at the cost of it becoming more powerful and sometimes adding new proprieties to the towers.
