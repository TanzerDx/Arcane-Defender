## 📖 Project Description

Unlike traditional tower defense games, **Arcane Defender** puts **you directly into the battlefield**.  
Your character is **fully moveable** within the playable area, able to **attack enemies** — but also vulnerable to their attacks.  

While you can fight, enemies become increasingly powerful, and **towers are essential** for survival. You must **build and upgrade magical towers** using resources and **magic energy crystals** 
dropped by defeated enemies. As waves progress, enemies drop **more valuable loot**, allowing for stronger defenses.

Your character has a **limited HP** and an **inventory system** to track collected resources.  
If you fall in battle, you’ll **respawn after a delay**, losing precious time — so efficient resource use and smart tower placement are vital.

Tower upgrades are **progressively more expensive** but significantly **increase their power** and may even **unlock new abilities**, giving you a tactical edge.
